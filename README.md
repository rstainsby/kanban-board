# Kanban Board

This project is not intended for commercial use. It is an opportunity for me to test and showcase my knowledge of Vue 3 and Nuxt.

The project is based on the [Kanban Task Management Web App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB) over on [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) - please check them out if you're looking for a project to test yourself with. All design and assets files are provided by [FrontEnd Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io).

## Software Architecture

This project is built using:

- Vue 3 as it's framework 
- Nuxt 3 as it's meta-framework
- Pinia for state management
- pnpm for package management (It's just so much faster than NPM, feel free to use whatever you like)

Some might consider Nuxt to be overkill for a project of this size but I feel that the pre-defined project strucuture, file based routing, robust plugins system and SSR all make it worthwhile to use for the majority of Vue 3 projects. I don't know why I feel the need to justify this on a personal project but here we are.
